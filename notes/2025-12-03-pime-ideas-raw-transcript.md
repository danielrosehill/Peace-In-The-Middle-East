Okay, so what I'm going to do in this repository? I'm just recording some notes here for, um, just kind of giving a little bit of an outline to this repository. I'm doing this going back through some of the projects I'm working on, uh, have been working on for a while now, um, to add this, uh, these notes then transcribe them just to sort of, uh, quickly provide some point in time information uh quicker than I can type it as to what these various, um, I think exciting ideas that I'm looking at with AI actually, uh, are sort of working towards. Um, just even though it's going to be in the metadata. Today is the 3rd of December 2025, uh, the 14th day of the month of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar. Okay, so this is a repository called Peace in the Middle East, uh, which is a tongue in cheek, uh, name because of course that is something we all aspire towards or at least peace, hoping, uh, peoples of this nation aspire towards a more peaceful, prosperous and stable Middle East. And, um, the idea occurred to me because I was chatting to, uh, a guy called Mike Taylor who's written a book, um, actually the first book that I bought about AI, an excellent book published by O'Reilly. I really enjoyed this called, Daniel, do you know, do you remember the name? Total descent into madness. I'm now addressing myself in the third person, uh, while speaking into a voice note for a GitHub repository. Um, but I think it's called something like prompt engineering for generative AI. Anyway, he has a startup called, uh, Ask Rally, that, um, use brings to life an idea that I've thought for a while is incredibly powerful, that of creating simulated panels, uh, based upon AI agents. So, let's say you wanted to sort of bounce your ideas, um, your philosophies off, you know, Aristotle and different representatives as it were of different philosophical schools. And they've kind of taken this, um, idea and made it more robust, um, by some very interesting, um, calibration mechanism using actual real people to make the proxies, um, more realistic and accurate. Um, so anyway, was looking through and I thought, wow, that's a great idea and I was looking at, I said, this would be great to try out a few of these experiments that I've been working on. Uh, so I created before I sort of set up the panels because you have to create an audience and then write system prompts, I knew that that wasn't going to be something that was feasible to do, uh, manually. So I created a repository with a few ideas for panels I thought would be really interesting. That was repository one. Rally panels. And then, um, so that those are kind of just my, that's for me going to be using it to actually test the platform out. Um, but then I thought, why don't I just, because this is a really big one. This is like, I mean there's, there's ways that this idea could be implemented for everything ranging from municipal politics through to social problems, but I thought, why not just create even just a starting workspace for what this would be like? Could this approach be leveraged for a really, really stubborn, thorny, intractable issue? And the one that came to mind of course immediately was the peace in the Middle East and, uh, uh, the peace process here. Um, I live in Jerusalem. So, that's my idea here and I'm set it up, um, trying to figure out a way when I was using Claude just to kind of help me to, um, create the, the description or converting my notes into something more readable was, I want to say this is very, very like this is just an idea to see might this have any utility. Uh, I would never want to come along and say, oh yeah, all you guys who've been trying to figure the Middle Eastern peace process out for 30 years are wasting your time. I just, like, I just figured it out with AI in, like, a few hours. Clearly that's not, uh, what's going to happen. But for the experiment to, I think, have any potential utility, um, I wanted to really sort of set it up in a way that encompassed the complexity of the problem. And to do that I thought firstly, well, we have all these different groups and interdependencies and webs in the Middle East, like there is the influence of Iran upon proxies in Lebanon and even within Lebanon there's internal descent between the LAF, uh, trying to, uh, trying to show that they're serious about demilitarizing Lebanon. What about Gaza? Um, you know, no one really, no one knows, no one seems to have any ideas at the moment for how to actually carry the ceasefire through to its real implementation of Hamas being demilitarized and there is it seems like the international community is kind of stuck. It's got this far. It's created this kind of very elaborate base. Um, there's been some good articles and commentaries about that. So that's an acute issue facing the region. And of course, then there's the bigger one of for assuming the vantage point of, you know, the majority of peaceful people maybe in the region who want, uh, to see, uh, uh, just a normal Middle East with more cooperation, more prosperity, less war. Um, could we simulate dialogue that is realistic? And the mechanisms that I was, the mechanism that I was exploring in this idea was, well AI agents can have a system prompt that defines their behavior and the first thing I was thinking is it would be, I don't want to have Benjamin Netanyahu personified as an AI agent, which you could do, um, so long as that wouldn't, you know, conflict with the system prompt to the vendor saying, you are embodying the personality of Netanyahu. You're this and that. Um, to my mind that approach would risk, uh, ethically problematic and, um, impersonating and all these kind of complications that I don't think need to be derail, um, the idea for that reason. So what I thought instead was having sort of like what Rally are trying to do with, uh, the different agents, like having personalities that are, it's said that like if I wanted to define Netanyahu in the third person as a Likud politician, whose views are hawkish on this, dovish on this, policies are this. Um, so to create agents that are kind of shadow, shadows of real, of the real political landscape in a certain geography. Uh, that was what I was kind of aiming for. And then I thought about, well, okay, this could be a summit. So let's say summits usually connote that it's a point in time, uh, political forum. And I thought it would really this would be this experiment would be useful if you could dip into it. I say, this development has happened. How do, how does the summit react? Lebanon, what do you make of this? Um, Jordan, do you have anything to say? And then take minutes, um, from, from it. So when I was actually thinking about how real political fora work, like the UN forum and the process of drafting resolutions and putting it out to to vote and gathering their responses and documenting it in these official journals. I thought, actually it's almost like a perfect, it's actually very, very, it's a very, um, it's a very useful system actually from the, from the perspective of trying to simulate that in AI because it's very rigid. We have resolutions as inputs. Uh, votes and statements can be, that's a great backbone for structured output definitions, right? Each, um, representative votes, that's binary data and each provides a resolution. That's, uh, long, long form text data. So, and then we gather that in the form of outputs and then we, uh, create summaries in our official journal. So, the whole process I've, I've just thought that it lends, could lend itself really well, uh, to simulations, geopolitical simulations of how a particular body would, um, would react. Now there's, in terms of sort of why I thought this might be useful, I can definitely see if someone wanted to, you know, spin off this idea for a, like a foreign affairs body or a government trying to say, okay, if we propose this, how will the other countries likely react? So let's send, let's propose a resolution to our AI body, um, our AI chamber and let's have them vote and, you know, we'll create a podcast based upon a three minute speech from each member where they summarize, and we might, that could be a really cool mechanism for exploring blind spots in, uh, policy formulation, debates. So I think that's a very, very valuable use case. But as just someone living in Jerusalem, not working on behalf of the state, really what interests me is more, okay, how can we kind of just work around the extremists? Like, how can we see a more prosperous Middle East? And in the microcosm I live in them Jerusalem, that's particularly pertinent where you've got kind of all these dynamics almost in miniature. You've got, um, a city that is split between Palestinian East Jerusalem, uh, Israeli West Jerusalem, differences, don't regard, differences of sort of allegiance to state, but nevertheless trying to find parts of common ground, uh, in the city. Um, I thought it was important as well for the design of this idea, an experiment, to include everyone. And in the Middle East, that's a lot of people. You have state actors. And what I thought about and I've noted this in the, in the notes for this idea, is that typically at a, at a, at a diplomatic forum, from what I know and understand about that world, you have, like, a permanent representation to the UN, let's say, which is a diplomatic mission, staffed by diplomats. You might have the Prime Minister addressing, but the Prime Minister isn't, like, living obviously at New York UN headquarters. Um, so what I thought was in, it would be less authentic to how diplomacy is conducted, but more useful for the experiment because in our fake agent world, we don't have that constraint. We don't, the this isn't real. The agent, the diplomatic mission can actually be the executive branch of government, can be the Prime Minister, president, foreign affairs, all the head honchos. Uh, the legal, the judiciary. We could listen in on their internal debates without eavesdropping on them. Like the Israeli delegation could be thinking and we'd see how the various inputs were, uh, that might be a really interesting approach that we'd have the actual modeling on real diplomacy. We'd have the diplomats maybe sort of directly engaging with the policy forum, but closed doors discussions between the, uh, the the state representatives embodies. Um, and beyond these different groups, then I kind of just mapped out some the minorities in the Middle East and sort of archetypal personas as I call them, like kind of, uh, tech, uh, you know, gonna say tech bros, but, uh, tech guys who think that tech is the way to to to make everything, you know, if everyone's prosperous, there'll be no violence. But then, the radicalized elements, uh, Hamas, um, Islamic Jihad, Hizbollah, IRGC, Qatar. Um, and then even within places like Syria where you might have, like the Israel Syria dynamic at the moment being super, super complex. I have a friend who is, that's his jam. Um, Jonathan, if he ever listens to this, uh, ramble. Uh, you know, and you've got probably on both sides of that bilateral relationship. You've got different groups that you've got, um, rebels in Syria, loyalists. And I'm sure within Israel, on the Israeli side between the IDF and the Foreign Affairs and the government, there's differences of opinion as to how to, um, navigate that relationship and try to, um, to what extent and anything approaching kind of peace is possible. I forgot Saudi Arabia. So, um, that's kind of what I was going for. Now, just a couple of things as I always think about how can this be, um, this is a nice idea, but is how is it going to work in practice? So, that's really where multi-agent frameworks come into play. And the one thing that I thought was vital is, uh, up to date information, which is where basically I've seen stuff like this, experiments like this fall down rapidly because, uh, they'll say, uh, what do you mean rapprochement, rapproche, rapprochement. What do you mean a reproach between Israel and Syria? Assad is the is the, you know, so it's it's so you need, um, up to the day knowledge for because the dynamics are moving so quickly. The knowledge base of the agent pool has to be, uh, up to date. Now, from an AI engineering standpoint, how is that's kind of tricky. And I think the best way to solve this is, uh, that the large language model, the set, the backbone of the agentic experiment, um, has to have real time capability baked in. So you can add real time, um, information exposure through the mechanism of, you know, uh, Tavilli, uh, perplexity, you can add it on as tooling. But that is very impractical when you've an experiment like this where, let's say, an assembly of 50 sub agents votes on a resolution. None of them inherently have real time information. So every single one needs to use the MCP, uh, which means you might have 50 parallel MCP calls, etc. It gets messy. So I think that it really has to be that all of them, all the models. And in terms of the model selection, well, it's kind of a, it's a tricky one to think what's best for something like this. Because you're generating a lot of text, uh, you wanted just my notes and experience on this, ideas like this, you want to use something that's cost efficient. You don't want to blow through, well, actually, we're gonna say for this use case, it's it's it's peanuts for compared to the cost of what it would take hypothetically to bring these groups, groups together. So, maybe scratch that thought. Now, I would say if you're just a person experimenting with me on your own dime, um, you, you might want to go for sort of a cheaper model, but then it's hard to find a model that's cheap for text, good for reasoning and has real time or near real time info. It's kind of the classic choose one, good, cheap, whatever the third axis of that is. Um, so that's in the cost constraint environment that might be challenging. Openwriter is my go-to for saying I've a bunch of models here and maybe I could try to find someone to, uh, donate to this project. Um, note to self, I should actually really maybe see if I have time to actually spend on this. Um, but in a non-cost constrained environment, I would say, you know, this is an really important, uh, idea, simulation and use the very best, uh, models available at our disposal today, which I would say I think for reasoning the combination of reasoning and agentic, I, I, I would regard, um, Anthropic's models, um, 4.5, right? We still at 4.5, 4.5 Opus, I would say is the gold standards. You've got your built in real-time data, you've got good reasoning, you've got good agentic stuff. Perfect, uh, great for this. And then, so what I did before I did one run of an agent UN and I was like, it was just an idea that occurred to me one morning that's a lot of these, uh, GitHub repositories I create, are created like that. Um, I just wake up and I'm like, oh my God, could you do this with AI? And then I say, wait, wait, I've got to work on stuff for clients. For anyone wondering, I do have actually, like a normal, uh, normal work existence. I'm just super, um, passionate about AI and these, um, I do spend a considerable amount of, uh, evening hours at the moment tinkering around with these ideas. Um, just because I'm, I just find it all so fascinating like what could, could hypothetically or potentially be done. So, um, coming back to my agent, that was the agent UN was one like that. I thought, this seems like very, it could be a very pure play little test of the idea of an assembly because, I think I started with the UN General Assembly and then said, why not just do the UN Security Council because it's less, um, less less states. And with the UN Security Council one, you know, I looked up who's on the UN SE just to make sure I had the right, uh, information. I looked up their internal procedures. And again, looking at that from an agentic standpoint, it's kind of perfect source material to work with, right? When you've a tightly defined and well documented voting procedure and, uh, veto procedure, it's kind of easy to replicate that in code actually. Um, and you just use stuff like Lang chain or Claude code, which is why I'm, um, really experimenting a lot with this stuff because it just when you don't even have to write the Python scripts, it makes it so much easier to just iterate and try out stuff. Um, and capture the resolutions. And as I said, then you want to do outputs. Even once you've gathered the outputs, let's say the, let's say that I have my, um, peace in the Middle East forum. I decide I want to put together, let's talk about the process of rebuilding Gaza. Very important, um, topic. Acute issue facing the region and seeing the ceasefire through to its implementation. Um, hugely complex. You've got Hamas sort of forcing their way, um, back into power in Gaza. You've got elements of the population who are resistant to it. You've got, uh, the US trying to nudging for the ceasefire but equally saying they're not gonna put foots on the ground. Uh, you've got the international community being asked to put their foots on the ground and maybe not feeling so enthused about doing that. Um, you've got the PA observing from afar. So, even in this little acute issue we have, if we were to assemble sort of a a work, working group to ideate ideas that might sort of be in any way useful to, um, to humans thinking about the same things. We would need a very broad, um, pool of agents here. And we'd also need, again, this is why, um, I mentioned in the in the Readme, Hamas has to be at this table. Even if they wouldn't, you know, Israel and Hamas have a policy, Israel and Hamas will only talk to each other in real life via Egypt or intermediaries. That could be baked into the experiment design. The Israeli delegation and Hamas do not communicate directly. That's a rule. If Hamas and Israel are to dialogue, we need to use Egypt as the intermediate, intermediating agent. So this is a kind of thing where, um, I keep thinking, like this would be really amazing. So it these are my kind of very loose initial ideas on this. Um, and I'll share these in the repository and maybe share them with an with a friend for thinking because I think if it were done well and thoughtfully, you could what what I think would be great to get from this, let's take the rebuilding of Gaza. Imagine putting this out to our summit. And we might choose a few different panels. One a very, very wide, uh, panel and the other a very narrow panel. And we'd ask it to agree on a resolution. Is there any way for see that can happen? Uh, very tall order. Um, and then proposals. So, I think that's really what comes next in the experiment ideation and design is figuring out a way to and that's again where the agentic stuff can be brilliant. We start with a massive glob of text, right? Each of these participants writes an essay much as happens in the UN when they all give long speeches. And then there is that second phase of we've gathered together this kind of corpus of text and opinions from these synthetic personalities. Well, how do we now translate that into information that might be actionable or useful? Like here are ideas. Now we move into the analysis layer of the, uh, experiment. And again where agentic can really help if it can process that much context saying, this is what we got from the virtual sitting of the forum today. Um, can you identify any novel ideas here? Is there anything in this in what the various parties have said where you can actually see there is any opportunity for peaceful alignment and consensus. And anything that hasn't been floated before. Compare what the summit thought about with what's being reported on in the media from Reuters and reputable sources. And can you see anything that the real world just didn't consider? Like that would be a major that would be amazing. So, that's, uh, the idea. Um, and I will leave it here for the moment.
