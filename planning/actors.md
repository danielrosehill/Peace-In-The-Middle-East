# Actors

The experiment/model will attempt to capture the breadth of actors involved in shaping the geopolitical reality of the modern Middle East. The experiment will attempt to be somewhat nuanced although achieving any meaningful degree of nuance is impossible in a setup of this nature.

## State Delegations

Each state will have a permanent representation to the Summit:

- Israel 
- Egypt 
- Jordan
- Palestinian Authority 
- Lebanon

Additionally:

- Cyprus
- Turkey
- Greece 

Additionally:

- UK
- Germany 
- France 
- Ireland 

Multilateral Institutions:

- UN - with representatives from UNTSO, UNDOF, UNIFIL 
- EU Foreign Affairs

## Non State Actors 

The following non-state actors will be represented at the Summit. 

Their inclusion is in no way an endorsement of their worldview. Certain agents may refuse to engage with these actors following their governments' real policies in this regard. Nevertheless, their inclusion is vital for the utility of this exercise:

- Hamas 
- Hizbullah 
- IRGC 
- Houthis 

## Faith Groups

Faith representatives from all major religions represented in the Middle East. 

## Minority Groups 

Minority groups within countries 

## Parallel Delegations 

In some instances there are substantial differences between de jure representatives of territories and non-state groups (for example: between the recognised government of Yemen and the Houthis; between Hizbullah and the LAF for military sovereignty in Lebanon). 

The simulation needs to start from reality - not an imagined version of it. To that end, it is suggested that in some cases multiple representatives participate from the same geographical region in a non-participative manner. 

## Influential States 

States with outsized influence in the region regardless of physical proximity:

- Saudi Arabia 
- Iran 
- Qatar
