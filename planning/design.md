# Summit Design

 The Summit should support convening two discrete types of Summit, modelled after a real political forum:

 - Acute crises requiring short term coordinated action between parties 
 - Long term issues 

## Synthetic Representatives 

An imperative ground rule for the operation of the Summit: delegates will represent real political entities and interests groups. But they will never be instructed to mimic or impersonate a real individual. 

However, and for realism, the synthetic agent "proxies" should attempt to mimic somewhat realistically the current political figures they are shadowing. That is to say: if a delegation of agents includes a prime minister, the prime minister agent should affiliate with the same politcal party and espouse the same worldview as the incumbent Prime Minister of Israel. Currency of information is vital so an external data source is a requirement.

## Summit Configurations 

The multiplicity of agentic personas is designed to capture very partially the complex interdependencies of the Middle East. 

However for practical reasons, these agents will need to be grouped into chambers.

Various permutations can be attempted but the core ones include:

- Governent and official representatives (modelling traditional multilateral diplomacy) 
- People to people fora 
- Working groups and committees (personas aligned around tackling specific issues regardless of nature)

## Working Groups & Tracks

- Economic cooperation 
- Peace and stability: encompassing deradicalisation, counter-terrorism 
- Regional cooperation 
- Normalisation
