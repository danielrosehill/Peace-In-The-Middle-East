# Peace In The Middle East: Agentic Geopolitical Summit

![alt text](banner.jpeg)

(PITME) Is an experiment in agentic AI.

The premise is straightforward:

- AI agents can be used to "embody" certain worldviews or personalities.  
- To an extent, our elected representatives, and our diplomats, are proxies for our nations. To an extent, they are not: person to person diplomacy is often touted as a way to circumnavigate the limitations of state-to-state dialogue. 

Protracted conflict provokes fatigue even among the most motivated and sincere of mediating parties.  

Organising geopolitical summits, between states, is extremely expensive. Time is of the essence, too: proposals need to be pre-screened for viability before being put on the negotiating agenda. 

When nations are at war, or in a state of permanent hostility, we turn to a familiar pool of potential sotluions that may not always yield results: multilateral institutions; states who take it upon themselves to act as the mediators. 

Even when this process is successful it is also, to an extent, opaque: the fate of many is shaped by the negotiations of a few which happens behind closed doors. It is exclusionary.

At the grassroots level, casual person-to-person diplomacy often goes unrecorded.  In the Middle East, there is a prevailing narrative that strength is valor and that concessions and negotiations are for the weak. 

This manifests in internal pressures, within societies, against "normalisation." Forms of enforcement and repression range from violence to economic coercion to the more nebulous social shunning.

There are complex webs of geopolitical interdependence, too: between Israel and the US; between Lebanon and Iran. Within societies, there are internal fractures. Problems may perpetuate for reasons other than those which are generally assumed to be true.

## Agentic Political Summit

There are abundant reasons to be skeptical about the idea that synthesized geopolitical actors, embodied in the form of AI personalities, could be anything other than ridiculous and delusional.

Equally, there's a powerful incentive to give the idea wide broach:

The cost of even a brief one day geopolitical summit involving heads of state can stretch into the tens of millions of dollars. The bill could pay the API costs for this project for the indefinite future.

The potential of millions of people in conflict-locked regions is held back by conflicts that they often had no role in starting nor in perpetuating. And - most pertinently - if AI is good enough to serve up an infinite stream of fantastically realistic cat photos, don't we owe it to ourselves to at least try it for something serious!?
